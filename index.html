    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Well, starting off, I definitely did not prepare early enough.
            Most of what I had to do was done roughly a month or two before the start of my quarter at UCLA.<br><br>
            To take a step back:<br>
            At the NAK we all have the not entirely normal, yet typical, <em>half-year</em> semester. This is not the case at UCLA or in most universities in the States, for that matter.<br>
            Here, mostly everything is based on the quarterly system (<em>which, as a side note, is a subjectively preferable choice</em>).
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Academic Highlights Section -->
    <section id="academics">
        <h2>Academic Highlights</h2>
        <p>
            Generally, at UCLA, you have a lot of choices from the UCLA Extension program.<br>
            They are pricey, though, so here is what I chose:
        </p>
        <ul class="course-list">
            <li><span class="course-name">Principles of Macroeconomics</span> <span class="course-price">: $722</span></li>
            <li><span class="course-name">Global Supply Chain Management</span> <span class="course-price">: $855</span></li>
            <li><span class="course-name">Cost Accounting & Analysis</span> <span class="course-price">: $855</span></li>
            <li><span class="course-name">HTML & CSS</span> <span class="course-price">: $1095</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I chose the first three based on subjects/classes that are mandatory in the Business-IT curriculum of the NAK.<br>
            HTML & CSS is one of the 3 mandatory free-choices, which in turns mean 2 more choices are waiting for me in Germany.
        </p>
        <h3>Learning Agreements</h3>
        <p>
            I completed the learning agreement way too late—about a month before my flight. But the NAK employees came through and checked my learning agreements within days, ensuring I was all set for my UCLA courses.<br>
            Don't forget that these are mandatory to be able to get the grades of the chosen abroad classes acknowledged.
        </p>

    <!-- Campus Life Section -->
    <section id="campus-life">
        <h2>Campus Life</h2>
        <div class="tiles-container">
            <div class="background-container"></div>
            <div class="tiles-grid">
                <div class="tile" id="tile-1" data-content="Nordakademie is pretty small and personal, which has its perks—you get to know everyone, and the professors are super approachable. UCLA, on the other hand, is massive. We’re talking over 45,000 students from all around the world. It’s a cultural melting pot, which makes it exciting but probably a bit overwhelming if you’re used to Nordakademie’s more intimate vibe.">Diversity</div>
                <div class="tile" id="tile-2" data-content="UCLA has over 1,000 clubs—seriously, there’s a group for just about anything. Whether it’s sports, coding, or even surfing, there’s something happening every day. Nordakademie has student clubs too, but on a much smaller scale. The variety at UCLA would be amazing, but it might also feel a bit chaotic compared to the more straightforward setup back home.">Clubs & Activities</div>
                <div class="tile" id="tile-3" data-content="Most students at UCLA live in dorms on campus, which are super social and have their own dining halls. It’s like living in a buzzing little community. At Nordakademie, most of us commute or live off-campus, which gives a bit more independence. Living at UCLA would be more of a full-on university experience, with constant activities and people around.">On-Campus Living</div>
                <div class="tile" id="tile-4" data-content="UCLA’s campus feels like a whole city. There are libraries, gyms, swimming pools, and iconic spots like Royce Hall. At Nordakademie, the campus is much smaller and more focused—you’ve got what you need without getting lost. UCLA’s scale would definitely be a big change, but it also means there’s always something new to explore.">Facilities</div>
                <div class="tile" id="tile-5" data-content="UCLA is crazy about sports. They have huge games, especially basketball and football, that bring thousands of students together. It’s all about school spirit. Nordakademie doesn’t really have that kind of sports culture—it’s more low-key. If you’re into the idea of big stadium vibes, UCLA would be a whole new level.">Sports</div>
                <div class="tile" id="tile-6" data-content="UCLA is known for its amazing dining halls. You’ll find everything from burgers to international dishes, and it’s all really high quality. Nordakademie’s food setup is a lot simpler, more about getting the job done. UCLA’s food scene would definitely feel like an upgrade if you’re into variety.">Food & Dining</div>
                <div class="tile" id="tile-7" data-content="UCLA is huge on academics, with tons of libraries, research opportunities, and famous professors. Nordakademie, though, balances academics with real-world experience through internships and smaller classes. UCLA has way more options, but you might miss that personalized support we’re used to at Nordakademie.">Academics</div>
                <div class="tile" id="tile-8" data-content="Nordakademie is in Elmshorn—a calm, practical spot close to Hamburg. UCLA? It’s in Los Angeles. Think beaches, Hollywood, and endless things to do. While Nordakademie offers a quieter, focused environment, UCLA throws you into the middle of a vibrant city with non-stop action.">Exploration</div>

    <!-- Exploring Los Angeles Section -->
   <section id="exploring-la">
    <h2>Exploring Los Angeles</h2>
    <p>
        Los Angeles is a city that offers something for everyone—from iconic landmarks to hidden gems. My time exploring LA was packed with adventures, but the real highlight was sharing those experiences with others.
    </p>
    <div class="exploring-destinations">
        <div class="destination">
            <h3>Santa Monica & Venice Beach</h3>
            <p>
                Santa Monica Pier is as iconic as you'd imagine, and Venice Beach has its own unique vibe. Whether you're walking along the boardwalk, checking out street performers, or just soaking up the ocean views, these spots are a must-see.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="destination">
            <h3>Marina del Rey</h3>
            <p>
                A quieter alternative to Santa Monica and Venice, Marina del Rey is perfect for relaxing by the water or grabbing a bite at one of the many waterfront restaurants.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="destination">
            <h3>Getty Museum & Griffith Observatory</h3>
            <p>
                The Getty Museum offers incredible art and even better views, while the Griffith Observatory is great for a night out with breathtaking cityscapes and stargazing.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="destination">
            <h3>Hollywood & Beverly Hills</h3>
            <p>
                The Walk of Fame, Beverly Hills, and other tourist hotspots are worth visiting for the photos and the experience. Just don't set your expectations too high—it can get crowded.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="destination">
            <h3>Downtown LA, K-Town, & Arts District</h3>
            <p>
                Downtown has its charm, but places like K-Town and the Arts District have their own energy. You’ll find amazing food and cool spots for a night out.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="destination">
            <h3>Compton (Drive Through)</h3>
            <p>
                Compton is an area I passed through—it’s probably not a spot I’d recommend exploring on foot, but driving through gives a different perspective of LA.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="destination">
            <h3>Universal Studios</h3>
            <p>
                Universal Studios is a fun experience, but if you're deciding between this and Disney, I’d honestly recommend Disney based on my friend's feedback.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="exploring-advice">
        <h3>Key Tip</h3>
        <p>
            Exploring LA is as much about the people as it is about the places. Finding a group to go on adventures with makes the experience a hundred times better. And luckily, meeting people is surprisingly easy!

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Applying to UCLA was a straightforward process through <strong>Mobility Online</strong> and the <a href="https://portal.uclaextension.edu/portal/logon.do?method=load">UCLA Extension Portal</a>. There were some fees involved, including an initial payment of <strong>$500</strong> upon acceptance. The total payment for the quarter was around <strong>$3800</strong>, with the remainder ($3300) due a month before the start.<br><br>
            <strong>Worth mentioning:</strong> Only the $500 for acceptance is needed to get a visa.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color: yellow;">
            This experience at UCLA has been transformative in so many ways, from adapting to a new academic environment to exploring a vibrant city like Los Angeles. I’ve gained a broader perspective on my studies and personal growth, and would encourage anyone interested in an exchange program to embrace the opportunity fully.
