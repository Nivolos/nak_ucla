        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Well, starting off, I definitely did not prepare early enough.
            Most of what I had to do was done roughly a month or two before the start of my quarter at UCLA.<br><br>
            To take a step back:<br>
            At the NAK we all have the not entirely normal, yet typical, <em>half-year</em> semester. This is not the case at UCLA or in most universities in the States, for that matter.<br>
            Here, mostly everything is based on the quarterly system (<em>which, as a side note, is a subjectively preferable choice</em>).

    <!-- Academic Highlights Section -->
    <section id="academics">
        <h2>Academic Highlights</h2>
        <p>
            Generally, at UCLA, you have a lot of choices from the UCLA Extension program.<br>
            They are pricey, though, so here is what I chose:
        </p>
        <ul class="course-list">
            <li><span class="course-name">Principles of Macroeconomics</span> <span class="course-price">: $722</span></li>
            <li><span class="course-name">Global Supply Chain Management</span> <span class="course-price">: $855</span></li>
            <li><span class="course-name">Cost Accounting & Analysis</span> <span class="course-price">: $855</span></li>
            <li><span class="course-name">HTML & CSS</span> <span class="course-price">: $1095</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I chose the first three based on subjects/classes that are mandatory in the Business-IT curriculum of the NAK.<br>
            HTML & CSS is one of the 3 mandatory free-choices, which in turns mean 2 more choices are waiting for me in Germany.
        </p>
        <h3>Learning Agreements</h3>
        <p>
            I completed the learning agreement way too late—about a month before my flight. But the NAK employees came through and checked my learning agreements within days, ensuring I was all set for my UCLA courses.<br>
            Don't forget that these are mandatory to be able to get the grades of the chosen abroad classes acknowledged.

        <p style="background-color: yellow;">
            Being in LA opened up a whole world of exploration beyond just the UCLA campus. From iconic beaches like Santa Monica and Venice Beach to , each part of the city had something unique to offer, making every outing an adventure.

        <p>
            Applying to UCLA was a straightforward process through <strong>Mobility Online</strong> and the <a href="https://portal.uclaextension.edu/portal/logon.do?method=load">UCLA Extension Portal</a>. There were some fees involved, including an initial payment of <strong>$500</strong> upon acceptance. The total payment for the quarter was around <strong>$3800</strong>, with the remainder ($3300) due a month before the start.<br><br>
            <strong>Worth mentioning:</strong> Only the $500 for acceptance is needed to get a visa.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color: yellow;">
            This experience at UCLA has been transformative in so many ways, from adapting to a new academic environment to exploring a vibrant city like Los Angeles. I’ve gained a broader perspective on my studies and personal growth, and would encourage anyone interested in an exchange program to embrace the opportunity fully.
